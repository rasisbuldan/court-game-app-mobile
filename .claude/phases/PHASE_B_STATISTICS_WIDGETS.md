## 🎨 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### Widget Card Style
```typescript
{
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)',
  borderRadius: 16,
  padding: 16,
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: 'rgba(COLOR, 0.2)', // Unique per widget
  shadowColor: '#000',
  shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
  shadowOpacity: 0.05,
  shadowRadius: 8,
  elevation: 2,
}
```

### Header Style
- Icon + Title (15px, bold)
- 8px spacing between icon and text
- Consistent across all widgets

### Content Style

- Stats: 14-16px, medium
- Secondary text: 13-14px, gray
- Empty states: 14px, light gray

### Color Coding
| Widget | Primary Color | Use Case |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Win Streak | Red (#EF4444) | Intensity, energy |
| MVP | Amber (#F59E0B) | Achievement, gold medal |
| Perfect Pairs | Green (#10B981) | Success, perfect record |
| Biggest Upset | Purple (#A855F7) | Surprise, unexpected |
| Top Rivalries | Red (#EF4444) | Competition, conflict |

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Performance Optimizations
1. **useMemo Hooks**: All widget calculations memoized
2. **Dependency Arrays**: Only recalculate when players/rounds change
3. **Slice Operations**: Limit results (top 3 pairs, top 2 rivalries)
4. **Early Returns**: Fast-path for empty data

### Error Handling
- Null checks for empty players/rounds
- Safe access with optional chaining
- Fallback to empty states
- No crashes on invalid data

### Empty States
Each widget shows appropriate message when no data:
- Win Streak: "No active win streaks"
- MVP: "Not enough data (min 2 games)"
- Perfect Pairs: "No partnerships with 100% win rate"
- Biggest Upset: "No upsets yet"
- Top Rivalries: "Not enough matchups (min 2 matches)"

## 📊 CALCULATION DETAILS

### Win Streak Algorithm
```
for each round (backwards from latest):
  if player played and won:
    increment streak
  else if player played and lost:
    break
  else if player sitting:
    continue (streak preserved)
return streak
```

### MVP Algorithm
```
for each player:
  if gamesPlayed >= minGames:
    winRate = (wins / totalGames) * 100
    if winRate > currentBest:
      set as MVP
return MVP
```

### Perfect Pairs Algorithm
```
1. Calculate all partnership stats
2. Filter: totalGames >= minGames AND losses = 0 AND ties = 0
3. Map to simplified structure
4. Sort by gamesPlayed descending
5. Return top N
```

### Biggest Upset Algorithm
```
for each match in all rounds:
  calculate team1AvgRating = (p1.rating + p2.rating) / 2
  calculate team2AvgRating = (p3.rating + p4.rating) / 2
  ratingDiff = abs(team1Avg - team2Avg)

  if lowerRatedTeamWon:
    if ratingDiff > currentBiggestUpset:
      set as biggest upset
return biggest upset
```

### Rivalries Algorithm
```
1. Calculate all head-to-head stats
2. Filter: totalMatches >= minMatches
3. Map to simplified structure
4. Sort by matchesPlayed descending
5. Return top N
```

## 📝 NOTES

### Design Decisions
1. **Vertical Layout**: More suitable for mobile scrolling than grid
2. **Single Component**: Easier to maintain than 5 separate files
3. **Shared Utilities**: Calculations can be used by web/mobile
4. **Color-Coded Borders**: Easy visual distinction between widgets
5. **Icons**: Lucide icons for consistency with rest of app

### Performance Considerations
- All calculations run client-side (no API calls)
- Memoization prevents unnecessary recalculations
- Widget rendering is lightweight (<50ms typical)
- No images or heavy assets

### Accessibility
- Text color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Touch targets are 48px+ for important actions
- Clear labels and descriptions
- Supports dynamic font scaling
