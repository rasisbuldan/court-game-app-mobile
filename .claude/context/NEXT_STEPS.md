# Recommended Next Steps

**Updated**: 2025-10-29
**Context**: After completing all priority phases (C, D, E, B)

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES** (Next 1-2 Sessions)

### 1. Device Testing ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Why**: Catch platform-specific issues before users do

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test on iPhone (iOS 15+)
  - [ ] Player management (add/remove)
  - [ ] All 4 scoring modes
  - [ ] Activity calendar interaction
  - [ ] Statistics widgets display
  - [ ] Overall app performance

- [ ] Test on Samsung A24 5G (Android 15)
  - [ ] Player management (add/remove)
  - [ ] All 4 scoring modes
  - [ ] Activity calendar interaction
  - [ ] Statistics widgets display
  - [ ] Overall app performance

**How to Test**:
```bash
# iOS
cd packages/mobile
yarn ios

# Android
yarn android
```

**What to Look For**:
- Border radius clipping issues
- Shadow/elevation rendering
- Touch target sizes (min 48dp)
- Keyboard behavior
- Modal animations
- Toast positioning

**Document Issues**: Add to `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`

---

### 2. Fix Supabase Type Definitions ‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Why**: Eliminate TypeScript errors, improve IDE experience

**Current Problem**:
```
app/(tabs)/profile.tsx has 10+ type errors
All related to missing Supabase type definitions
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# In packages/mobile
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/types/database.types.ts
```

**Then Update**:
```typescript
// config/supabase.ts
import { Database } from '../types/database.types';

export const supabase = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
```

**Verify**: Run `yarn typecheck` - should have 0 NEW errors

---

### 3. Performance Testing ‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Why**: Ensure app handles large datasets smoothly

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Large Player Count**
   - Create session with 50 players
   - Monitor widget calculation time
   - Check leaderboard scrolling performance

2. **Many Rounds**
   - Play 20+ rounds
   - Monitor round generation time
   - Check statistics tab responsiveness

3. **Activity Calendar**
   - Profile with 30 active days
   - Check calendar render time
   - Test interaction responsiveness

**Tools**:
```typescript
// Add performance markers
console.time('widget-calculation');
const widgets = calculateWidgets(players, rounds);
console.timeEnd('widget-calculation');
```

**Thresholds**:
- Widget calculations: < 100ms
- Round generation: < 500ms
- UI interactions: < 16ms (60fps)

---

## üìã **SHORT-TERM TASKS** (Next 1 Week)

### 4. User Acceptance Testing ‚≠ê MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: Varies
**Why**: Real user feedback drives priorities

**Approach**:
1. Recruit 3-5 beta testers
2. Give them specific tasks:
   - Create a session with 8 players
   - Add a late player mid-session
   - Use "first_to" scoring mode
   - Check their activity calendar
   - Review statistics widgets

3. Collect feedback:
   - What was confusing?
   - What felt slow?
   - What features are missing?
   - What would improve their experience?

**Document**: Create `USER_FEEDBACK.md` with findings

---

### 5. Remaining Features (Phases A, F, G, H, I) ‚≠ê LOW
**Estimated Time**: 10-20 hours total
**Why**: Complete feature parity with web

**Priority Order** (if implementing):
1. **Phase A**: Session Sharing with PIN (2-3 hours)
2. **Phase F**: Parallel Courts Mode (3-4 hours)
3. **Phase G**: Player Profile Integration (2-3 hours)
4. **Phase H**: Advanced Analytics (3-4 hours)
5. **Phase I**: Reclub Import (2-3 hours)

See `FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for details.

---

## üîß **TECHNICAL DEBT** (Ongoing)

### 6. Jest Testing Setup
**Status**: Has configuration issues with Expo
**Priority**: LOW (manual testing working)

**Issue**:
- Tests fail with Expo import errors
- `jest-expo` preset has compatibility issues

**Options**:
1. Fix jest setup (1-2 hours research)
2. Switch to Detox for E2E testing
3. Rely on manual testing + TypeScript

**Recommendation**: Keep manual testing for now, revisit later

---

### 7. Code Organization
**Status**: Could be improved
**Priority**: LOW

**Potential Improvements**:
- Extract widget components to separate files
- Create shared UI components (Card, Button)
- Move platform styles to theme file
- Consolidate color constants

**When to Do**: During refactoring sprint, not now

---

### 8. Documentation
**Status**: Comprehensive but could be enhanced
**Priority**: LOW

**Gaps**:
- API documentation for shared package functions
- Component prop documentation (could use Storybook)
- Video walkthrough of features
- GIF demos for README

**When to Do**: Before public release

---
