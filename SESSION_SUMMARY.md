## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- iOS: Uses BlurView, shadows, borderRadius
- Android: Uses elevation instead of shadows, more opaque backgrounds
- Both: Touch targets minimum 48dp for accessibility
- Both: Memoized expensive renders for performance

### Database Schema
No changes required. Uses existing:
- `players` table (with status column)
- `game_sessions` table (with scoring_mode column)
- `event_history` table (for logging)
- `profiles` table (for user info)

### Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Uses existing:
- React Native 0.81.5
- Expo SDK 54
- Supabase 2.57.3
- React Query 5.70.1
- lucide-react-native (icons)
- date-fns (date formatting)

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Test on devices** - Run on iOS and Android
